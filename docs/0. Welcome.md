### What is Havoc
Havoc is a modern, malleable post-exploitation command and control framework made for penetration testers, red teams, and blue teams. <br>
It's free and [open source on github](https://github.com/HavocFramework/Havoc) written and maintained by [Paul Ungur (C5pider)](https://twitter.com/C5pider)

### How does Havoc work? 
The Havoc Framework is split into 2 parts. 
The Teamserver handles connected operators, tasking agents and parsing the callback, listeners, and downloaded files and screenshots from the agents. It should run on a public VPS to be accessible by known and registered operators.<br>
The Client is the user interface for the server. There you can interact, task agent's commands and receive output from them. <br>
