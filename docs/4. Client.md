# 4. Client

The Havoc Client user interface is written in QT C++ applied with the [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/) theme. 

The Interface is split into three parts. The top left of the interface shows a visualization of sessions as table form or node graph. The top left of the interface shows the event viewer which displayes following events: newly connected user/operator, start of a listener or failed start of listener with error message and newly connected implants. The bottom of the interface displays tabs like interacted session, file explorer, listener table and other Havoc features.

### Start 
The Havoc Client is easy to start by typing in the following command:
```
./havoc client
```
After you typed it in you should see the following connection dialog.

The Name field can be any profile name (for example like `Death Start` or `Teamserver`).

In the fields `Host` and `Port` should contain the teamserver host address/domain and port. 

In the fields `User` and `Password` should contain the username and password specified in your yaotl 
profile. 

If you are seeing this following error then it most likely means that you passed the wrong username and or password.
