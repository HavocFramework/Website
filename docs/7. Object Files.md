# 12. Object Files

The Havoc agent supports in-memory execution of object files, commonly known as Beacon Object Files or BOFs.  

To execute an object file, you can run:  `inline-execute /tmp/objectfile.x64.o`

## Python modules
From python, you can pack data as you normally do in Cobalt Strike. You can find several examples of how to do this in [this](https://github.com/HavocFramework/Modules) repository.  

## Get the output of a BOF in python (Experimental)
Also, you can run an object file and obtain the result with a callback, like so:
```python
def my_callback(demonID, worked, output):
    print('hi there! I am the python callback of the "locale" BOF')
    print(f'demonID: {demonID}')
    print(f'did the BOF run ok?: {worked}')
    if worked:
        print('here you have the output :)')
        print(output)
        print('bye!')

def locale( demonID, *param ):
    TaskID : str    = None
    demon  : Demon  = None

    demon  = Demon( demonID )

    return demon.InlineExecuteGetOutput( my_callback, "go", "ObjectFiles/locale.x64.o", b'' )
```
