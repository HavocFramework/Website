# 6. Agent 

Havoc **default** agent which is called the Demon agent has a lot of builtin features and it's malleable and modular by design. 

### About Evasion

You might ask if the Demon agent bypasses anti-virus (AV) products or even endpoint detection and response (EDR) products, most likely not. 
The Demon agent wasn't designed to be evasive nor was it within the scope. It was designed to be as malleable and modular as possible to give the operator as much power over it to adapt it for the red team operation without overloading it with evasion techniques and features that are going to be most likely burned and going to be an IOC by itself. And the devs of the agent don't wanna play the cat and mouse game with AV & EDR vendors. 
That said, the Demon agent is designed to be interoperable with common techniques for bypassing anti-virus software such as loaders, packers, crypters, and stagers.

### Demon Features & Configuration

The Demon agent has a lot of features that can be used and configured. 

In the payload generation window (`Attack -> Payload`) you can configure your Demon payload.
![HavocPayloadWindow](/images/assets/HavocPayloadWindow.png)

| Configuaration   | Description                       |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Sleep            | Sleep delay between each callback |  
| Indirect Syscall | Use of indirect syscalls          |
| Sleep Technique  | Sleep obfuscation technique.      |

For the sleep obfuscation technique, 3 options can be used. 
- `Foliage` is a sleep obfuscation technique that creates a new thread and uses `NtApcQueueThread` to queue an ROP chain that encrypts our agent memory and delays execution. (Author of this technique is [Austin Hudson](https://twitter.com/ilove2pwn_))
- `Ekko` is a sleep obfuscation technique that uses `RtlCreateTimer` to queue up an ROP chain that encrypts our agent memory and delays execution. ([Original Github repository](https://github.com/Cracked5pider/Ekko))
- `WaitForSingleObjectEx` is not a sleep obfuscation technique. It just delays the execution and doesn't perform any kind of sleep encryption.

`Injection` Configuration:

| Configuaration | Description                                        |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Alloc          | What technique to use when allocating memory.      |  
| Execute        | What technique to use when executing a pointer.    |
| Spawn64        | x64 injection target for post exploitation modules |
| Spawn86        | x86 injection target for post exploitation modules |

`Native/Syscall` is using `NtAllocateVirtualMemory`/`NtCreateThreadEx` either from Ntdll.dll or if `Indirect Syscall` has been checked it's going to build a stub that uses the `syscall` instruction from another native function (which in this case is `NtAddBootEntry`).

`Win32` is normal windows API (`VirtualAllocEx`/`CreateRemoteThread`)

#### The `help` command
Shows how to use the specified command. 

|||
|--|--|
| Expected Arguments | `<command>` | 

![command](/images/assets/commands/help.png)


> If a parameter is around a `[]` then it means it is required to specify the argument. 
> 
> If a parameter is around a `()` then it means it is optional and can be left out.  

#### The `sleep` command
Sets the sleep delay between each tasking routine and request. The delay should be specified in seconds.

| Expected Arguments | `<delay>` |
