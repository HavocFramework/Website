# 1. Installation

[Havoc source code](https://github.com/HavocFramework/Havoc.git) available on [github](https://github.com/HavocFramework/Havoc.git) and can be cloned using `git clone`:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HavocFramework/Havoc.git
``` 

After cloning Havoc we are going to need to change the current directory to the cloned repository. 
```bash
cd Havoc
```

### Install the dependencies
After following the steps above we need to install the needed dependencies for the teamserver and compile it to our final executable. Be aware that the teamserver requires golang 1.18 to be able to compile and run. 

#### Ubuntu 20.04 / 22.04

> You must enable Python 3.10 in your APT repositories before you can run the Client successfully.

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.10 python3.10-dev
```

#### Kali and other Debian based Distros only.
> The immediate following is for Debian based Distros only.
```
sudo apt install -y git build-essential apt-utils cmake libfontconfig1 libglu1-mesa-dev libgtest-dev libspdlog-dev libboost-all-dev libncurses5-dev libgdbm-dev libssl-dev libreadline-dev libffi-dev libsqlite3-dev libbz2-dev mesa-common-dev qtbase5-dev qtchooser qt5-qmake qtbase5-dev-tools libqt5websockets5 libqt5websockets5-dev qtdeclarative5-dev golang-go qtbase5-dev libqt5websockets5-dev python3-dev libboost-all-dev mingw-w64 nasm
```

#### Debian 10/11

> You must setup the `bookworm` repo for Python 3.10.

```
echo 'deb http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian bookworm main' >> /etc/apt/sources.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-dev python3.10-dev libpython3.10 libpython3.10-dev python3.10
```

#### Arch-based Distros

```
sudo pacman -S git gcc base-devel cmake make fontconfig glu gtest spdlog boost boost-libs ncurses gdbm openssl readline libffi sqlite bzip2 mesa qt5-base qt5-websockets python3 nasm mingw-w64-gcc go
```

#### MacOS

> You must have [`homebrew`](https://brew.sh) installed.
```
brew install --cask cmake
brew install python@3.10 qt@5 spdlog golang
brew link --overwrite qt@5
```

### Building the Teamserver
Install additional Go dependencies:
```bash
cd teamserver
go mod download golang.org/x/sys
go mod download github.com/ugorji/go
cd ..
```

Build and Run:
```bash
# Install musl Compiler & Build Binary (From Havoc Root Directory)
make ts-build

# Run the teamserver
./havoc server --profile ./profiles/havoc.yaotl -v --debug
```

All files created during interaction with the Teamserver are stored within the `/Havoc/data/*` folder.

### Building the Client
Now that we successfully compiled the teamserver we now should install the dependencies for the Client and compile it.  

Build and Run:
```
# Build the client Binary (From Havoc Root Directory)
make client-build

# Run the client
./havoc client
```

After we finished compiling the teamserver and client we can start the teamserver and client from the havoc executable.
```txt
$ ./havoc
