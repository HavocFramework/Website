# 1. Installation

[Havoc source code](https://github.com/HavocFramework/Havoc.git) avaliable on [github](https://github.com/HavocFramework/Havoc.git) and can be cloned using `git clone`:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HavocFramework/Havoc.git
``` 

After cloning Havoc we are going to need to change the current directory to the cloned repository. 
```bash
cd Havoc
```

Now lets try to get the lastest version from github. 
And keep in mind, everytime there is a new major version of Havoc you need to type in this command to get the lastest version:
```bash
git pull
```

### Teamserver
After following the steps above we need to install the needed dependecies for the teamserver and compile it to our final executable. Be aware that the teamserver requieres golang 1.18 to be able to compile and run. 
Install the golang compiler: 
```bash
# install golang and mingw on arch linux based distros (like Manjaro)
sudo pacman -S go mingw-w64-gcc

# install golang and mingw on ubuntu based distros
sudo apt install -y golang-go mingw-w64

# lets check if we got the right version. 
go version
```
Be sure that `go version` shows 1.18 or greater.

### Client
Now that we successful compiled the teamserver we now should install the dependecies for the Client and compile it. 
The Havoc Client is written in QT C/C++ and following dependecies are requiered to get it to run: 

* libspdlog-dev
* Python 3.10 (python3-dev)
* qt5

Those dependecies can be installed using the following command:
```bash
# install deps for arch linux based ditros (like Manjaro)
sudo pacman -S qt5-base qt5-websockets spdlog gcc make cmake

# install deps for ubuntu based ditros
sudo apt install -y qtbase5-dev libqt5websockets5 libspdlog-dev python3-dev gcc make cmake
```

### Compile everything
Last but not least we are going to compile the teamserver and client into executables by typing the following command: 
```
make
```

After it finished compiling the teamserver and client we are able to start the teamserver and client from the havoc executable.
```txt
