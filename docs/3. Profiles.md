# 3. Profiles

The Havoc Yaotl configuration language is a configuration file that contains everything that the teamserver needs to run. 
Yaotl is a fork of the popular configuration language [HCL](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl). 

### Syntax
Blah blah blah show on how to use the syntax like blocks, strings, integers, and arrays

### The `Teamserver` block
The `Teamserver` block holds the necessary information to bind the teamserver on a host and port where it is going to listen and accept client connections. 

| Field  | Type    | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `Host` | string  | The specified address is going to be used to bind to. | true
| `Port` | integer | The specified port is going to be used to bind to.    | true

Both Host and Port are required to be specified. Those values are going to be used to listen and accept incoming client connections. 
Example:

```hcl
Teamserver {
	Host = "0.0.0.0"
	Port = 40056
}
```

<br>

The `Teamserver` block also has an sub block called `Build` where you can specify the compiler to use for compiling C and assembly files. If this block is not specified then the teamserver is going to search and use the avaliable mingw cross compiler (`x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc` and `i686-w64-mingw32-gcc`). If the teamserver doesn't find the mingw/nasm compiler on the system and from the profile then its going to exit. 

| Field        | Type   | Description |
|--------------|--------|-------------|
| `Compiler64` | string | What compiler to use to compile the C source code into an x64 binary | true
| `Compiler86` | string | What compiler to use to compile the C source code into an x86 binary (currently not used. reserved for future use) | true
| `Nasm`       | string | What compiler to use to compile the Assembly code into an x64/x86 binary | true

Example: 
```hcl
Teamserver {
	Host = "0.0.0.0"
	Port = 40056

	Build {
		Compiler64 = "/usr/bin/x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc"
		Compiler86 = "/usr/bin/i686-w64-mingw32-gcc"
		Nasm 	   = "/usr/bin/nasm"
	}
}
```

### The `Operators` block
The `Operators` block specifies the users that are going to be allowed to connect and interact with the teamserver. To add a new user you only need to specify the username and password. 
Example User Block:
```hcl
user "MyUsername" {
	password = "MyPassword" 
}
```
Example Operator Block: 
```hcl
Operators {
	user "5pider" {
		Password = "password1234"
	}

	user "Neo" {
		Password = "password1234"
	}
}
```

### The `Listeners` block
The `Listeners` block allows the operator to start a listener without doing it manually in the client interface. 

This block has the following sub blocks `Http` and `Smb` that allows to start a listener with the desired protocol. 

&nbsp;

The `Http` block allows to configure and start a Http/Https listener. Following fields can be configured.

| Field	  | Type | Description | Required  
|---------|------|-------------|---------
| `Name`  | string | listener name | true
| `Hosts` | string array | takes an array of hosts/ip strings. Those values can be formated as following: `host:port` (example: `host.com:443`) to set the host and port to connect to or simply `host` (example: `host.com`) to connect to. If only the host has been specified then the binded port is going to be used. If no hosts where specified then the binded host and port is going be used. | false
| `Port`  | int | Where the listener should to bind on | true
| `HostBind` | string | Where the listener should to bind on | true
| `HostRotation` | string | Host rotation technique to use.  | true
| `UserAgent`  | string | What user agent can/should be used | true
| `Headers`  | string array | What headers can/should be used. if nothing is provided then the listener is going to use `Content-type: */*`. Or else the agent wont be able to callback. | false
| `Uris`  | string array | What uri's to use. if nothing provided then the listener is going to use `/`. | false
| `Secure` | bool | if SSL should be used or not (HTTPs). | true
| `Cert`     | block | Certification files for HTTPs. If not specified the teamserver is going to generate a random cert/key files to use | false
| `Proxy`    | block | Proxy configuration for HTTP/HTTPs requests | false
| `Response` | block | How should the listener responde to the agent request | false

&nbsp;

Avaliable options for the `HostRotation` field:
