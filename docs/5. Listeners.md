# SMB

The SMB Demon uses named pipes to communicate through a parent Demon. 
This peer-to-peer communication works with Demon on the same host and across the network.

| Field	       | Type   | Description     | Required  
|--------------|--------|-----------------|---------

# External C2 

| | |
|-|-|
| Supports Demon Agents   | `true` |
| Supports Service Agents | `true` |

&nbsp;

External C2 is a specification to allow third-party programs to act as a communication layer for Havoc's Demon agent and registered service agents. 

This listener is binds the `Endpoint` value to an endpoint from the teamserver main HTTP/s server (which handles Havoc's client requests).

It then should be reachable via this url: `http://{teamserver}:{port}/{endpoint}`
