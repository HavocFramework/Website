Teamserver\r\n\r\nThe Havoc Teamserver is the core server which starts listeners, interact with agents and handles operators commands.\r\nThe Teamserver can be configured using the Yaotl configuration language. \r\n\r\n### Flags\r\n\r\nIf we type `./teamserver server -h` we see a bunch of flags that the teamservers supports.\r\n```\r\n$ ./teamserver server -h\r\nserver command\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n  teamserver server [flags]\r\n\r\nFlags:\r\n      --profile string   set havoc teamserver profile\r\n      --debug            enable debug mode\r\n      --debug-dev        enable debug mode for developers (compiles the agent with the debug mode/macro enabled)\r\n  -d, --default          uses default profile (overwrites --profile)\r\n  -v, --verbose          verbose messages\r\n  -h, --help             help for server\r\n```\r\n\r\n`--profile` is a flag that takes a string path to a yaotl configuration. This file contains values that the teamserver need to run like what host and port to host the server on. \r\n\r\n`--debug` is a flag that takes a boolean. It tells the teamserver to either run in debug mode or not. Debug mode contains a lot of information on what is currently happening. But it is recommended to have this flag turned to `false` which is by default. \r\nIt is only used or recommended to be used when the teamserver unexpetectly exists or crashed to get further information for the cause and where it exactly happened. \r\n\r\n`--debug-dev` is a flag that takes a boolean. This flag tells the teamserver agent builder to compile the agent with debug mode enabled. In this mode the agent is going to print debug values. This can be helpful in case that the agent crashes, searching for the cause and for debugging purposes. But it is recommended to have this flag turned to `false` which is by default. \r\n\r\n`-d | --default` is a flag that takes a boolean. It tells the teamserver to use default values for running the server. But it is recommended to have this flag turned to `false` which is by default. \r\n\r\n`-v | --verbose` is a flag that takes a boolean. It tells the teamserver to show the timestamp for each printed message. It is recommended to have this flag turned to `true` which isn't by default. \r\n\r\n### Example\r\nA small example on how the teamserver flags can be used. <br>\r\n\r\nStart the teamserver normally with verbose messaging:\r\n```\r\nsudo ./teamserver --profile profiles/havoc.yoatl -v\r\n```\r\n\r\nStart the teamserver with default profile:\r\n```\r\nsudo ./teamserver -d\r\n```\r\n\r\nStart the teamserver with verbose and debug flag enabled: \r\n```\r\nsudo ./teamserver --profile profiles/havoc.yaotl --verbose --debug\r\n```\r\n\r\nStart the teamserver with with the `debug-dev` to compile the agents in debug mode (mostly for debug purpose only or identify where the agent crashes): \r\n```\r\nsudo ./teamserver --profile profiles/havoc.yaotl --debug-dev\r\n```"},"__N_SSG":true}
